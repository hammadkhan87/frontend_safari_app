The park is particularly known for the abundance of Ancient Baobab trees (the largest trees on the continent) which fill the landscape and dwarf the animals next to them. The river of the park is full of wildlife ranging from a large variety of birds to lions, leopards, zebras, giraffes, buffaloes, antelopes, and, of course, elephants. In fact, the park has the largest concentration of elephants in the whole country and provides unique chances to observe the interaction between elephant families. The lunch area is fascinating, boasting an observatory with amazing views of the river and wildlife (with good chances of seeing a hunt while having your picnic). In the afternoon we will still do a game drive before continuing to your accommodation.",

Permanent residents of this park also include giraffes, elephants, impalas, and a huge amount of buffaloes. The lake is also home to a large number of hippos. The landscapes of Lake Manyara are something that can not be described with words, and the game drives along the lake provide stunning photo opportunities of giraffes and buffaloes in the foreground and the lake (and its flamingos) in the background.

This will be an unforgettable moment for anyone seeing it for the first time. As you progress well into the Serengeti, you will see why the name means, in Swahili, 'endless plains'. The park has 6,900 sq. miles and for most of it, the plains will stretch to the horizon defying your senses and perception of distances. It is the home of the Great Migration and to 2 million wildebeests, hundreds of thousands of zebras, and all kinds of antelopes including the abundant impalas and Thomson's gazelles. As for Big Cats and large predators, it's the place of choice to look out for lions, cheetahs, leopards, hyenas, with many television scenes like the famous river crossings having been filmed in this park.\n\nFull day in the Serengeti National Park. We are completely flexible with your preferences and this day will be organized according to your wishes. On every day of the safari, your guide will discuss with you the best timings for you, including the game drives and the wake-up time. For example, on this day, you could do a morning game drive, return to the camp for lunch and relaxation and finish with an afternoon game drive, or you could do a full day game drive with a picnic lunch.",

It's one of the very rare locations in the whole continent where you can witness the Black Rhino. The crater has a river, several swamps, a soda lake with a great concentration of flamingos, a forest, and open plains. It's also famous for its elephants which, are the largest in the world and have huge tusks.
