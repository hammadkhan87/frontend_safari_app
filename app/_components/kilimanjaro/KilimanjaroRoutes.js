      description: "Also known as the 'Whiskey Route', Kilimanjaro's Machame Route is one the most popular climbing routes in Tanzania. Better yet, this route has a fantastically high success rate. The route has a gradual ascend which gives your body more time to adjust to the altitude. The trail circles around the mountain, offering up spectacular views and a wide variety of landscapes.",
      duration: "6-7 days",
      difficulty: "Medium",
      successRate: "High",
      pros: [
        "Less expensive than most of the others, due to its shorter route and easy access",

      description: "This route, nicknamed the 'Coca-Cola' route, has a reputation for being one of the easiest paths on the mountain. Though it is certainly the shortest route on the mountain, this does not necessarily mean it is the easiest! As this is a shorter route, your body has less time to acclimatize properly, increasing the chances of fatigue and ultimately decreasing the chances of reaching the summit on this route.",
      duration: "5-6 days",
      difficulty: "Medium",
      successRate: "Medium",
      pros: [
        "The Marangu Route is one of the cheapest and quickest Mount Kilimanjaro routes",

        "Best for those on a budget",
        "Shorter duration than other routes"
      ],
      cons: [
        "This route can be quite busy, especially during the peak season",
        "As you will do the same trail for your descent as you did for your ascent, you get to see less of the spectacular scenery!",
        "Lower success rate due to poor acclimatization",

      description: "The Lemosho Route is a beautiful and unique route, known for its breathtaking views. In contrary to other Mount Kilimanjaro climbing routes, it starts on the western side of Kilimanjaro. Because of this, the Lemosho Route is less crowded with climbers and offers a much more secluded hiking experience. Better yet, the Lemosho trail is completely unspoiled, making for a breathtakingly beautiful adventure up to the famous Shira Plateau.",
