              The most popular time to visit Zanzibar is during the dry season, from June to October and from December to February. However, Zanzibar Island is a great beach destination all-year round.

              We prefer the personal atmosphere of the small bed & breakfast lodges on the island. The staff is so friendly and will do everything you make sure you have a great time. Another benefit of bed & breakfasts is that you can explore other restaurants and bars during the day and evening. There are so many great places to eat and have a drink, with beautiful views over the ocean and a great ambiance.

              "Zanzibar is a fantastic, beautiful island. I stayed in the village Jambiani and the Zanzibari (local people) are so friendly and welcoming. They are always up for a chat. The beaches, spice farms, forests and little villages are so beautiful. The only drawback i can think of is the lack of museums, but it can also be I did not went to the right places. There are so many nice restaurants and bars on the island where you can eat delicious local or western meals and dance."

              "Zanzibar is a great beach destination you don't want to miss when you visit Tanzania. It is a paradise and the perfect place to end your safari. We stayed at the eastcoast of the island where you can find amazing beaches. The beaches are pretty quiet with no annoying beach boys. We have eaten delicious sea food for a fair price at several restaurants."
